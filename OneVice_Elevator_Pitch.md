# OneVice Elevator Pitch

## **Specialized Agents for Strategic Intelligence**

OneVice deploys **four specialized AI agents with advanced tooling** that transform strategic decision-making across the entire VICE ecosystem. Our **Sales & Pre-Call Brief Generator** instantly maps the overlap of contacts, projects, connections, and crew across departments—turning every sales meeting into a strategically informed conversation about cross-ecosystem opportunities. The **Case Study Portfolio Agent** analyzes treatments, decks, scripts, and historical work to provide deep insights on past performance patterns and guide future project development with data-driven creative intelligence.

The **Talent Discovery Agent** goes beyond simple searches, providing comprehensive talent profiles including past projects, current availability, union details, and collaboration networks that reveal the perfect creative matches for any production. Meanwhile, our **Bidding Intelligence Agent** leverages historical budgeting data to craft winning proposals, identify package deal opportunities, and surface potential cross-ecosystem collaborations that maximize value for both VICE and clients.

## **Cross-Agent Collaboration: The Strategic Multiplier**

The real power emerges when these **specialized agents work in tandem** for comprehensive cross-departmental strategies. Imagine preparing for a major client pitch: the Sales Agent identifies key relationship overlaps and collaboration opportunities, the Case Study Agent pulls relevant past work and performance metrics, the Talent Agent suggests the perfect creative team based on client preferences and budget, while the Bidding Agent crafts competitive pricing with strategic upsell opportunities—all working together to create an unbeatable proposal.

This **collaborative intelligence architecture** means every department decision is informed by the entire VICE ecosystem. When VICE NEWS considers covering an emerging artist, the system simultaneously identifies potential STUDIOS documentary opportunities, VIRTUE brand partnership angles, and existing talent relationships across all divisions. For leadership, this represents **strategic decision-making at scale**, where institutional knowledge compounds across every interaction, turning VICE's creative expertise into sustainable competitive advantage.

## **3-Tier Memory: The Intelligence Foundation**

OneVice's revolutionary **3-tier memory system** ensures your strategic intelligence grows smarter with every interaction. **Redis provides instant session memory**—every conversation, preference, and strategic insight is immediately accessible across all agents. **LangMem delivers advanced conversational memory** that learns departmental patterns, role-specific needs, and provides increasingly personalized cross-ecosystem insights over time. **Neo4j powers our knowledge graph memory**, creating an interconnected web of relationships between talent, projects, brands, clients, and opportunities that reveals hidden strategic connections and collaboration potential that no single department could identify alone.
