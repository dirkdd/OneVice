SEARCH_SCOPE: ALL entities (people, projects, organizations, documents, treatments, content)
SEARCH_METHOD: Vector similarity + text matching across entire graph

MANDATORY_PARALLEL_EXECUTION: 
‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Always call this tool IN PARALLEL with specific entity tools
‚ö†Ô∏è  NEVER call this tool alone for comprehensive queries

PARALLEL_PATTERNS:
‚úÖ Organization query: get_organization_profile("company") + broad_vector_search("company treatment writer")
‚úÖ Person query: get_person_details("person") + broad_vector_search("person")
‚úÖ Treatment query: search_projects_by_criteria + broad_vector_search("treatment writer company")

USE_WHEN:
- ANY query requiring comprehensive coverage
- Treatment/project writer searches
- Cross-entity relationship discovery  
- Ensuring no relevant information is missed
- Finding connections between different entity types

QUERY_ENHANCEMENT_EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "boost mobile" ‚Üí broad_vector_search("boost mobile treatment writer director")
‚úÖ "courtney phillips" ‚Üí broad_vector_search("courtney phillips writer director projects")
‚úÖ "who wrote treatments" ‚Üí broad_vector_search("treatment writer screenplay director")

COVERAGE: Vector similarity across people bios, project descriptions, organization data, document content

Input: search_query (str) - Enhanced query to find relevant data across the entire graph
Returns: Comprehensive results across people, projects, organizations, and documents"""
