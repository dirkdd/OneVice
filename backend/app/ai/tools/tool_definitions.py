ENTITY_TYPES: company, organization, business, brand, client, corporation
CONFIDENCE_INDICATORS: company names, brand names, business entities, "work with [company]", "for [company]", "client [company]"

USE_WHEN:
- Queries mention company/organization names (Nike, Apple, Boost Mobile, Netflix, Disney, McDonald's)
- "Do we work with [company]?" 
- "Who wrote treatments for [company]?"
- "Find [company] projects"
- Business entity lookup requests
- Client relationship queries

DO_NOT_USE_WHEN:
- Personal names (John Smith, Mary Johnson, Courtney Phillips)
- Individual people queries ("Who is John Smith?")
- When looking for specific people rather than companies

EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "boost mobile" ‚Üí get_organization_profile("Boost Mobile")
‚úÖ "netflix projects" ‚Üí get_organization_profile("Netflix") 
‚úÖ "who wrote treatments for disney" ‚Üí get_organization_profile("Disney")

‚ùå "courtney phillips" ‚Üí use get_person_details instead
